      Finish the setup (wires Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok CLI and OpenCode and starts the background service):
        lightbulb setup
      After `brew upgrade`, run `lightbulb setup` again so the background service moves to the new version.
      Everything off and out: lightbulb setup --remove
